       "'In 1972, Biden defeated Republican incumbent J. Caleb Boggs to become the junior U.S. senator from Delaware. He was the only Democrat willing to challenge Boggs, and with minimal campaign funds, he was given no chance of winning. Family members managed and staffed the campaign, which relied on meeting voters face-to-face and hand-distributing position papers, an approach made feasible by Delaware\\'s small size. He received help from the AFL–CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell. His platform focused on the environment, withdrawal from Vietnam, civil rights, mass transit, equitable taxation, health care, and public dissatisfaction with \"politics as usual\". A few months before the election, Biden trailed Boggs by almost thirty percentage points, but his energy, attractive young family, and ability to connect with voters\\' emotions worked to his advantage and he won with 50.5 percent of the vote. At the time of his election, he was 29 years old, but he reached the constitutionally required age of 30 before he was sworn in as Senator.'"

Neilia\\'s station wagon was hit by a semi-trailer truck as she pulled out from an intersection. Their sons Beau (aged\\xa03) and Hunter (aged\\xa02) were taken to the hospital in fair condition, Beau with a broken leg and other wounds and Hunter with a minor skull fracture and other head injuries. Biden considered resigning to care for them, but Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield persuaded him not to. Years later, Biden said he believed the truck driver had been drinking before the crash, but was never charged, and the driver\\'s family said the deaths haunted him until he died in 1999. Biden later apologized to the driver\\'s family. The accident filled Biden with anger and religious doubt. He wrote that he \"felt God had played a horrible trick\" on him, and he had trouble focusing on work.'"
